      **Divest/Invest RGV was founded in 2020 by a group of transformative justice activists based in the Rio Grande Valley in the wake of the George Floyd uprising, connecting over the need to divest from punitive systems, and reinvest in networks of care.** Our work has been sustained by autonomous participation with love at the center. We work to build a new way of gathering, practicing safety, understanding, and organizing in an abolitionist framework, based on the incredible lineage of abolitionists before us.
