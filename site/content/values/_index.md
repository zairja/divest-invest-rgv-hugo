      * We keep each other safe, not the police
      * Respect and honesty 
      * Recognition of power and privilege that we have when we’re taking/making space 
      * Intentional with our language
      * Conflict resolution system (see below)
      * Keep ego in check
      * Center experiences and leadership of those who have been directly affected by police violence and the carceral state.
      * The burden of police violence is borne primarily by black and brown communities. We will strive to fight racism, particularly anti-black racism, in all work that we do.
      * Recognize that policing in the U.S. was created to enslave black people and persists to criminalize poor communities of color and protect capital.  
      * Working through/toward consensus
      * On the border, recognize the intersection with our carceral violent immigration system. Divesting from LE means divesting from all forms of law enforcement. This fight is also against the border wall and against the criminalization of immigrants, #nooneisillegal
      * Acknowledge the patriarchal system and the major impact it has on women (especially WOC) & the lgbtq+ community mental health and leadership opportunities/development 
      * Able to give/receive constructive criticism
      * Must be willing to work in a group
      * Safe environment for all 
      * To recognize the school to prison pipeline that exists in our communities, and how the youth in our communities are criminalized  
      * Attempt to call someone in before calling them out
      * Land acknowledgement

      • No isms (racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia transphobia)

      • Bring issues to the table in real time. Avoidance is unhealthy and can lead micro aggression towards the person who caused the harm

      • Attempt to repair when harm is done

      • Communicate boundaries in terms of capacity

       • How do we want to do this? Community based, or a mutual chosen mediator to hear both parties? Other ideas?

       • Group votes to remove if a serious injury or harm is done

       • Creating a road back into our safe space for those removed after harm had been done.
