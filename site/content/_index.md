  heading: Mission Statement
  text: Divest/Invest RGV is dedicated to informing, organizing and empowering our community in the struggle to diverge from systems rooted in anti-blackness, oppression and violence. We recognize all systems created during colonization are designed to uphold white supremacy, and that we must lay a foundation for alternatives to issues such as policing and mass incarceration, with marginalized peoples at the center of our vision. Through research, education, conversations with our neighbors, and community-centered solutions we can divest from punitive justice and invest in an environment where everyone's needs are met and we all feel safe.
